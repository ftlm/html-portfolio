  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I am Fatlum Haxhiu, passionate about coding.<br>I was born in 1988<br>
    I wanted to create different websites. <br>
    I've been programming since I was 16 years old.</p>

  <p>I remember when we were learning Pascal programming language at school, I don't know why but I didn't understand anything from this language hahahaha.</p>
  
  <p>Now I have learned several programming languages such as: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, JAVA, SQL, and libraries: React JS, Node JS and Express JS.</p>
  
  <p>I like to be challenged while solving a problem in programming, and I feel very relaxed after solving a problem while coding.</p>

  <p>So let's code together.</p>
